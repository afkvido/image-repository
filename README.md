# gemsvid√∏'s image repository
hi people

### Q&A: Why am I using this?
GitHub is like a free file sharing website, better than Imgur/MediaFire. I'm using this repo to host image assets.

### Q&A: Can I make pull requests here?
why would you want to anyways. probbably **no**, but maybe. if you're adding an image i wanted or i asked you to add, then yes.

### Q&A: Why is this public?
private repos have tokens for raw content, meaning i can't host images with a private repo
